# Web Calcultor project
The aim of this project is to create a website to numerical as well as calculus computations. For convenience, the server uses a locally deployed Express framework. However, it is also possible to make the website accessible on the public internet, that would require renting a cloud server as well as a domian.

## Web demo 1 - Interface

The website is designed to include a drop-down **Options** menu, allowing users to switch between calculating derivatives and integrals.
After clicking the **Language button**, all instructions on the website will switch to the corresponding language, without refreshing the page. In this case, selecting CN will change the language to Chinese.

Clicking the **Color** button toggles the webpage between dark mode and light mode. A short animation is included during the transition.
